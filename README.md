# Word-Guess-Game
A simple Javascript-based "Word Guess Game" where the user tries to guess the word correctly. The user is allowed twelve attempts to guess the word. The game captures the user's key strokes and converts them into right or wrong guesses - right and wrong letter guesses are either displayed in the pool of letters within the current word "magic word" or in the pool of wrong letters.
